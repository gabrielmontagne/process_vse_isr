From the ISR docs,
https://github.com/idealo/image-super-resolution#pre-trained-networks

=== Basic model,

RDN model, PSNR driven, choose the option weights='psnr-large' or weights='psnr-small' when creating a RDN model.

=== GANS model

RRDN model, trained with Adversarial and VGG features losses, choose the option weights='gans' when creating a RRDN model.

=== Artefact Cancelling GANS model

RDN model, trained with Adversarial and VGG features losses, choose the option weights='noise-cancel' when creating a RDN model.
